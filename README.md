# Web-Research-Sprint-1
For the coursework of web research


Abstract:
Recent studies by the Higher Education Funding Council England (HEFCE) have shown that 3/5 disabled students have dropped out or have considered dropping out of university after their first year because of the lack of support on their courses. This is mainly due to the fact that communication cannot be made easily between the student and lecturer during lectures and practicals. The UK Disability Discrimination Legislation states that ‘reasonable adjustments should be made to ensure that students with disabilities are not at a disadvantage during their education’ (SENDA 2001.)

However, with new advances in machine learning technology, it is possible for machines to automatically caption human speech in real time to help disabled students in the classroom. Thus, disabled students are able to experience a more beneficial study life and could possibly improve the dropout rates of disabled students in the UK. 

This report will assess and analyse the benefits and drawbacks of the current existing software or systems for Real Time speech captioning. This report also attempts to adapt accessible educational multimedia through the use of machine learning technologies for disabled students within the United Kingdom and elsewhere.
