# Abstract
Recent studies by the Higher Education Funding Council England (HEFCE) have shown that 3/5 disabled students have dropped out or have considered dropping out of university after their first year because of the lack of support on their courses. This is mainly due to the fact that communication cannot be made easily between the student and lecturer during lectures and practicals. The UK Disability Discrimination Legislation states that ‘reasonable adjustments should be made to ensure that students with disabilities are not at a disadvantage during their education’ (SENDA 2001.)

However, with new advances in machine learning technology, it is possible for machines to automatically caption human speech in real time to help disabled students in the classroom. Thus, disabled students are able to experience a more beneficial study life and could possibly improve the dropout rates of disabled students in the UK. 

This report will assess and analyse the benefits and drawbacks of the current existing software or systems for Real Time speech captioning. This report also attempts to adapt accessible educational multimedia through the use of machine learning technologies for disabled students within the United Kingdom and elsewhere.


# How to Run speech to text on a vm 
1. git clone https://github.com/Hydrangea028/Web-Research-Sprint-1.git
2. cd Web-Research-Sprint-1
3. node server
4. go to localhost:8080

# Extra Information
- Please ensure express is installed, using npm install express
- npm install to ensure all packages are implemented to run this file
- Before logging into your server, you will need to create a SSH tunnel from port 8080 that goes to localhost:8080, this can be achieved using putty. connect to your ip as usual and run the server through node.
- On google chrome go to localhost:8080
